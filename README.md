# CodeExample

This is a code example to demostrate my ability. Included in this is deserialization of JSON and recursion.
In the code example is a small game to move from room to room in a cave. The json file can be changed or added to for different rooms or to test room validation.

To build and run the sample, change to the *src/NewTypes* directory and execute the following command:

```console
dotnet run
```
